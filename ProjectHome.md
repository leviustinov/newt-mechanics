NOTE: This project has been solemnly created to pass my A level Computing (COMP4 AQA Computing).

The program will solve Newtonian mechanics based programs based on the parameters and values provided (such as forces, mass, friction etc.) The answers (unknown values) will be resolved and displayed in a text and visual (diagram) manner (static or not).

For example problems see Mechanics 1 AQA A2 level mathematics course.
